# test_libs
Some test Libraries for a presentation on development security.

These are likely (depending on what I'm testing) to do bad things to systems that they are installed on .

So don't install them, really.

For more information about why these exist please see http://raesene.github.io/blog/2015/03/01/software-library-repositories-and-security/
